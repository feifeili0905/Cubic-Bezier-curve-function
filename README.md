# Cubic-Bezier-curve-function
This project is for the Cubic Bezier curve function code which is related to the conference paper '3D Cubic Bezier Curves for Multi-targets Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles'.
This project includes the calculation of the curvature of 3D curve; the basic equations for the 3D Bezier curve
