# Cubic-Bezier-curve-function
This project is for the Cubic Bezier curve function code which is related to the conference paper '3D Cubic Bezier Curves for Multi-targets Path Planning for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles'.
This project includes the calculation of the curvature of 3D curve; the basic equations for the 3D Bezier curve
% This function can help you draw the bezier curve between two points and it includes
% the selection for the control points along the control points lines
% the x0 are the matrix for the two targets points, 
% the angle11 and angle2 are the input and output angles for the targets domain
